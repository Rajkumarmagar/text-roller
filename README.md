TextRoller
========

TextRoller is a Javascript and CSS library for smoothly transitioning words.
This plugin is largely derived from the plugin [Odometer](https://github.com/HubSpot/odometer) made by 
[Adam Schwartz](https://twitter.com/adamfschwartz) and 
[Zack Bloom](https://twitter.com/zackbloom) of HubSpot.
